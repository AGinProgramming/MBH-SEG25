# MBH-SEG25 solution
## Summary
MICCAI - MBHSEG 2025 Multi-class Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation in Non-contrast CT Challenge solution

### Model - nnUNetv2

Using the newest nnUNetv2 as the baseline of the model to train on the voxel-level training dataset. 
   - The input and preprocessing steps follow the nnUNet rules so that the nnUNetv2 model can read and process the data.
   - The 3d_fullres configuration was selected.

Model can be downloaded by:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet.git
cd nnUNet
pip install -e .
 ```

### Data processing

The voxel-level dataset was used for the baseline model pre-training. The case-level dataset was selected and joined to the voxel-level training dataset for self-training steps.

### Multi-Rater Evaluation

   - During the training with the voxel-level training dataset, each annotation from different raters in the same case was considered as a ground truth, noted with the rater's ID number.
   - During the self-training phase, the predictions of the case-level cases were considered as pseudo labels instead of a single ground truth. They were treated as an external annotation source and served as auxiliary annotations during the self-training.

## Inference

### Environment and installations:
you can use either conda --> environment.yml to create the emvironment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nnunet_env
 ```
or pip --> requirements.txt to install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download model weights
Download model weights from:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yM6iR6KDjj-VsbuGHAIkv4l0ip2VLUeb?usp=drive_link

### Run Inference
after install and activate the environment, form the test dataset into the proper data form
```bash
python /path_to_data_form.py/data_form.py
```
where 'base' and  'out_base' should be replaced by the real path of the raw data and the folder which stored the reformed data in.

### Run prediction
```bash

python test_script.py \
  --model_folder /path_to_model_inputs/model_inputs/Dataset888_weak/nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres \
  --input_folder /path/to/reformed/raw \
  --output_folder /path/to/save_predictions \
  --folds all \
  --checkpoint checkpoint_best.pth

```
The outcome will be NIFTI(.nii.gz) files.

### Evaluations
Simply run:
```bash
python competition_evaluation.py --pred_path /path/to/predictions --gt_path /path/to/annotations
```
